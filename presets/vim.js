# New Vimproved ModalKeys 2.0

![](../images/pooh.jpg =375x403)
Providing full Vim emulation was not originally a goal of ModalKeys. The idea of
the extension is to provide an engine that allows the user to [map any key
combination to any command provided by VS Code](../README.html#configuration).
However, most users equate modal editing with Vim and are familiar with its
default keybindings. Vim users really love the powerful key sequences that
combine editing operations with cursor motions or text ranges.

ModalKeys has also evolved by taking inspiration from Vim. Many capabilities
were added with the motive to enable some Vim feature that was previously not
possible to implement. With version 2.0 ModalKeys's functionality is now
extensive enough to build a semi-complete Vim emulation. So, here we go...

Adding Vim keybindings as optional presets serves two purposes: it lowers the
barrier to entry for Vim users who don't want to spend the time defining
bindings from ground up. Secondly, Vim presets serve as an example to show
how you can build sophisticated command sequences using the machinery provided
by ModalKeys.

![importing presets](../images/import-preset.png =553x94)
If you are not interested on how the Vim keybindings are implemented and just
want to use them, you can skip this discussion. Just import the presets by
pressing <key>Ctrl</key>+<key>Shift</key>+<key>P</key> and running command
**ModalKeys: Import preset keybindings**. You will be presented a choice to
import either Vim bindings or any presets that you have created yourself. If
you are planning to customize the bindings, or create Vim-style commands from
scratch, this document gives you pointers how to go about with that.

## Game Plan

We start with basic motion commands which are mostly straightforward to
implement. Motions have two modes of operation: normal mode (moving cursor), and
visual mode (extending selection). We make sure all motions work correctly in
both modes. This allows us to reuse these keybindings when implementing more
advanced operations. Our goal is to avoid repetition by building complex
sequences from primitive commands.

In Vim, there are multiple key sequences for a same operation. For example,
you can convert a paragraph upper case by typing
<key>g</key><key>U</key><key>i</key><key>p</key>. You can perform the same
operation using visual mode by typing <key>v</key><key>i</key><key>p</key><key>U</key>.
The trick we use is to convert key sequences that operate on character, word,
line, paragraph, etc. to analagous key sequences that use visual mode. We can
implement all the editing commands just to work on active selection and reuse
these commands with the other key combinations. Consequently, command definition
becomes a string mapping problem. Since we can use JavaScript to expressions to
do string manipulation, these mappings are easy to formulate.

Many ways to skin a cat...

## Motions in Normal Mode

The list of available cursor motion commands is shown below.

| Keys      | Cursor Motion
| --------- | -------------------
| `Enter`   | Beginning of next line
| `Space`   | Next character on right
| `h`       | Left
| `j`       | Down
| `k`       | Up
| `l`       | Right
| `0`       | First character on line
| `$`       | Last character on line
| `^`       | First non-blank character on line
| `g_`      | Last non-blank character on line
| `gg`      | First charater in file
| `G`       | Last character in file
| `w`       | Beginning of next word
| `e`       | End of next word
| `b`       | Beginning of previous word
| `W`       | Beginning of next alphanumeric word
| `B`       | Beginning of previous alphanumeric word
| `H`       | Top of the screen
| `M`       | Middle of the screen
| `L`       | Bottom of the screen
| `%`       | Matching bracket

Now, lets implement all the keybindings listed above.

## Jump to a Character

Advanced cursor motions in Vim include jump to character, which is especially powerful in
connection with editing commands. With this motion, we can apply edits upto or including a
specified character. The same motions work also as jump commands in normal mode. We have to
provide separate implementations for normal and visual mode, since we need to provide
different parameters to the `modaledit.search` command we are utilizing.

| Keys          | Cursor Motion
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------
| `f`<_char_>   | Jump to next occurrence of <_char_>
| `F`<_char_>   | Jump to previous occurrence of <_char_>
| `t`<_char_>   | Jump to character before the next occurrence of <_char_>
| `T`<_char_>   | Jump to character after the previous occurrence of <_char_>
| `;`           | Repeat previous f, t, F or T motion
| `,`           | Repeat previous f, t, F or T motion in opposite direction

All of these keybindings are implemented using the [incremental
search](../README.html#incremental-search) command, just the parameters are different for
each case. Basically we just perform either a forward or backward search and use the
"offset" option to determine where the cursor should land.

| `C`   | Change rest of line (delete and switch to insert mode)
| `Y`   | Yank (copy) rest of line
| `p`   | Paste contents of clipboard after cursor
| `P`   | Paste contents of clipboard at cursor
| `J`   | Join current and next line. Add space in between
| `u`   | Undo last change

## Editing with Motions

So, far we have kept the structure of keybindings quite simple. Now we tackle
the types of keybinding that work in tandem with motion commands. Examples of
such commands include:

<key>c</key><key>i</key><key>b</key> - Change text inside curly braces `{}`

<key>></key><key>G</key> - Indent rest of the file

<key>y</key><key>\`</key><key>a</key> - Yank text from cursor position to mark `a`

We can combine any editing command with any motion, which gives us thousands
of possible combinations. First type the command key and then motion which
specifies the position or range you want to apply the command to.

| Keys          | Command
| ------------- | ---------------------------
| `d`<_motion_> | Delete range specified by <_motion_>
| `c`<_motion_> | Delete range specified by <_motion_> and switch to insert mode
| `y`<_motion_> | Yank range specified by <_motion_> to clipboard
| `>`<_motion_> | Indent range specified by <_motion_>
| `<`<_motion_> | Outdent range specified by <_motion_>
| `=`<_motion_> | Reindent (reformat) range specified by <_motion_>

We can define all commands listed above in a single keybinding block. Remember
that our strategy is just to map the key sequences of the edit commands that use
motions to equivalent commands that work in visual mode. We do the specified
motion in visual mode selecting a range of text, and then running the command
on the selection. It does not matter which editing command we run, all of them
can be mapped the same way.

## Searching

Searching introduces a pseudo-mode that captures the keyboard and suspends other
commands as long as search is on. Searching commands are shown below.

| Keys      | Command
| --------- | --------------------
| `/`       | Start case-sensitive search forwards
| `?`       | Start case-sensitive search backwards
| `n`       | Select the next match
| `p`       | Select the previous match

**Note**: Searching commands work also with multiple cursors. As in Vim, search
wraps around if top or bottom of file is encountered.

it has been changed. There is no way to get around this in VS Code.

## Conclusion

The list of commands we provided is by no means exhaustive but still contains
literally thousands of key combinations that cover the many commonly used Vim
operations. This is quite a nice achievement considering that we only wrote
about 600 lines of configuration, and most of it is pretty trivial. This
demonstrates that ModalKeys's functionality is powerful enough to build all
kinds of operations that make modal editors like Vim popular.
